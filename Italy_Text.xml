      Greetings oh mighty Albion. You have led the Lombards to found what will become modern Italy. Can you now expand your borders to form a civilzation to compare to the Roman Empire before you? Can you hold together your coalition of forces and conquer other lands? Or will you seek to form a society based upon culture rather than the sword?

  Albion was king of the Lombards. During his reign the Lombards ended their migrations by settling in Italy, the northern part of which Alboin conquered. Albion was later assasinated by the Byzantines in a coup d'etat organised by Helmichis, his foster brother who was supported by Albion's wife Rosamund. Most of the Lombards opposed this and it failed.</Text>

  In 568 AD Albion, a young leader of the Lombards, led the Lombard migration into Italy. At least 20,000 Saxon warriors joined them with their families. The first city to fall was Forum Iulii in 569 AD. Verona, Vicenza and Bresica soon followed. Milan fell to the Lombards in the summer of 569 AD as the small Byzantine army guarding it could do nothing to prevent it. They continued to conquer further south. At it's height the Lombard territory was divided into 36 duchies, whose leaders settled in the major cities of each duchy. However this subdivision led to weakness. After the assaination of Albion and his successor Celph there was a period known as the Rule of Dukes when no King was elected until 584 AD.
